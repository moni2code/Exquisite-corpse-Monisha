One of the most impressive moment in my life was to attend a series of one-week celebration and ceremonies preceeding Nyepi Day (loosely translated as The Day of Silence). On the eve of Neypi, there was a parade during which the people were fillin up the streets of Seminyak (a popular, touristic region in Bali). Several of those people were carrying together a giant 2-meter long of papier-mâché sculptures of representation of evil spirits. On top of that, Balinese traditional music is played throughout the parade, making it super lively.

I thought these sculptures were rather unique.
